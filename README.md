# docker-virtualradarserver

Dockerized version of [VirtualRadarServer](https://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/) for Linux.

Current and latest release is on the `:dev` branch. Latest stable releases are at `v3pX` branches - according to the availabe pre-releases of VRS.

## Requirements
This container initially expects SBS data input via network from a running instance of e.g. [readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf), [readsb bare-metal](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb) or [tar1090](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090) (as long it's attached to your SDR). Any other data sources _should_ work, as long they offer one of the [supported formats](https://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/Documentation/WebServer/ReceiversOptions.aspx).

It will run on a Raspberry Pi, recommended is a Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 2GB RAM. As VRS is a bit of ressource hog, your results will depend very much on the amount of planes your receiver picks up (or you get from some other sources).

Refer to [VRSLayers](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomLayers/tree/main#default-options) for further information about the defaults you can set in the docker-compose.yml

Virtual Radar server can be accessed at `http://<HOST_IP>:8085/VirtualRadar` VRS should auto default to desktop or mobile display depending on the type of device you are using to access it. You can force this by appending `/desktop.html` or `/mobile.html` to the web address give here.

The final configuration is done via the VRS Web Admin Interface, which can be found at `http://<HOST_IP>:8085/VirtualRadar/WebAdmin/Index.html`
After startup, VRS will point to `readsb` as it's first and only receiver - which will work out of the box if the container is in the same stack as `readsb`, which is the case if you followed [this guide](https://sdr-enthusiasts.gitbook.io/ads-b/).

On first startup the container downloads [some additional files](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSOperatorFlags), namely a pre-populated BaseStation.sqb, a [LocalAircraft.txt](https://github.com/rikgale/LocalAircraft) which corrects some incorrectly tagged (civil a/c flagged as military a/c or visa versa only) aircrafts and some nice custom Operator Flags and Silhouettes made by [rikgale](https://github.com/rikgale) and the group effort of [the community](https://discord.com/channels/734090820684349521/797799467880677377).
Everything is constantly updated and help is much appreciated. Any requests for operator flags / silhouettes can be filed through the [issues](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSOperatorFlags/issues).

Subsequent updates of the files occur on a container-restart. Additionally, the originating repository is checked every 6 hours for updates. New files will be downloaded automatically.

Requests for additions to the LocalAircraft.txt go [Here](https://github.com/rikgale/LocalAircraft/issues).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VRS_ADMIN_USERNAME` | Username used for login to WebAdmin | `required` |
| `VRS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password used for login to WebAdmin | `required` |
| `VRS_CULTURE` | see [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb896001.aspx) for a list of supported culture names. Not all translations may be available | `unset` means `en-GB` |
| `VRS_DB_UPDATE_BACKUP_UNCOMPRESSED` | Works only in conjunction with `VRS_DB_UPDATE_POLICY_FULLAUTO`. Prior the update a backup of the database is created. If this is set, the backup will remain uncompressed | `unset` |
| `VRS_DB_UPDATE_POLICY_FULLAUTO` | Activates the initial download of an extended Basestation.sqb DB and keeps it up to date. Warning! This may overwrite user entries | `unset` |
| `VRS_DB_UPDATE_WITH_VACUUM` | Works only in conjunction with `VRS_DB_UPDATE_POLICY_FULLAUTO`. DB is compressed after update. The update takes longer but the sqb will be smaller.| `unset` |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_LAYERS_CONFIG` | The configuration for the default map, enabled layers and menu buttom position. See the docker-compose.yml example above! | `unset` defaults to example values |
| `VRS_DB_UPDATE_BACKUP_UNCOMPRESSED` | Works only in conjunction with `VRS_DB_UPDATE_POLICY_FULLAUTO`. Prior the update a backup of the database is created. If this is set, the backup will remain uncompressed | `unset` |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_MARKERS` | Installs and activates VRS custom markers. `normal` is for the ADS-B set and `disable` deactivates the markers. [Here](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomMarkers) are more details about the markers. | `unset` |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_LAYERS_COUNTRY` | Installs and activates VRS enhanced layers. Takes a country code as input. Currently availble are `UK`, `DE`, `USA1`, `USAAZ`, `SE`,`AU`,`IN`,`ID`,`NL`,`FR`,`ES`. [Here](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomLayers) are more details, feel free to open an issue there to get your country on board. | `unset` - Unknown country codes will default to UK |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_LAYERS_OPENWX_APIKEY` | For the enhanced weather layers to work, you need an API key. Again,  [here](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomLayers) are more details, and instructions how to obtain an API key. | `unset` |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_LAYERS_OPENAIP_APIKEY` | For the OpenAIP layers to work, you need an API key. Again,  [here](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomLayers) are more details, and instructions how to obtain an API key. | `unset` |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_LAYERS_STADIA_APIKEY` | For the [Stadia map](https://docs.stadiamaps.com) to work, you need an API key. Again,  [here](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomLayers) are more details, and instructions how to obtain an API key. | `unset` |
| `VRS_ENHANCED_LAYERS_THUNDERFOREST_APIKEY` | For the [Thunderforest map](https://www.thunderforest.com) to work, you need an API key. Again,  [here](https://github.com/rikgale/VRSCustomLayers) are more details, and instructions how to obtain an API key. | `unset` |
| `VRS_SILHOUETTES_DUALVIEW` | If set, then the "Dual View Silhouettes" will be used. The set of DV Silhouettes might be incomplete. | `unset` |
| `VRS_SBSHOST` | IP or hostname of a BaseStation ADS-B data feed provider. In general it's more easy to set up the receivers on the WebAdmin panel | `unset` defaults to `readsb` |
| `VRS_SBSPORT` | Port the BaseStation ADS-B data feed provider | `unset` defaults to `30003` |

If not stated otherwise, the envvars should be set to "yes" or "true" (or actually anything, as long they are set.)
